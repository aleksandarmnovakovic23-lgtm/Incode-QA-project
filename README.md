# AutomationExercise — Playwright Test Suite

Playwright + TypeScript test suite covering the public API and browser UI of
[automationexercise.com](https://automationexercise.com).

---

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Version |
|---|---|
| Node.js | ≥ 18 |
| npm | ≥ 9 |

---

## Installation

```bash
cd InCodePlaywrite
npm install
npx playwright install chromium --with-deps
```

> API tests do not require a browser binary. You can skip the second command if you only
> want to run API tests.

---

## Running Tests

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm test` | Run all tests (API + E2E) |
| `npm run test:api` | API tests only — no browser needed |
| `npm run test:e2e` | E2E tests only — requires Chromium |
| `npm run test:headed` | E2E tests with a visible browser window (single worker) |
| `npm run report` | Open the last HTML report in your browser |

### Run a single spec

```bash
npx playwright test tests/api/products.api.spec.ts
npx playwright test tests/e2e/auth.spec.ts
```

### Run by test title substring

```bash
npx playwright test --grep "login"
```

## CI/CD

The `.github/workflows/ci.yml` workflow:

- Triggers on push/PR to `main` / `develop` and on a daily schedule (06:00 UTC weekdays)
- Runs **API tests** and **E2E tests** as parallel jobs
- Uploads HTML reports and failure traces as artifacts (14-day retention)
- Sets `retries: 2` in CI to absorb transient network flakiness against the live external server

To use in CI without GitHub Actions, the equivalent commands are:

```bash
npm ci
npx playwright install chromium --with-deps  # E2E only
npx playwright test --reporter=github,html
```

## Key Design Decisions

**Response code assertion strategy.** The AutomationExercise API always returns HTTP 200.
The actual result code (200, 201, 400, 404, 405) lives in the JSON body's `responseCode`
field. All API tests assert `body.responseCode`, not `response.status()`.

**Test data isolation.** Each test that registers a user generates a unique email via
`Date.now()`. `beforeAll` / `afterAll` hooks create and delete test accounts via the API.
This avoids leftover state between runs.

**No test data file.** There are no hardcoded credentials in the repository. All users are
created on-the-fly per run.

**Page Object Model.** Selectors are centralised in `lib/page-objects/`. Tests describe
intent (`loginPage.login(...)`) rather than mechanics (`page.fill('input[data-qa=...]', ...)`).

---

## Known Flakiness Sources

- **Ad overlays** — the site renders third-party ad iframes that can intercept clicks. If a
  test fails with "element intercepts pointer events", re-run it; this is an ad timing issue.
- **Network latency** — this is a live external service. Occasional slow responses may cause
  timeouts on the first attempt. CI retries handle this.
- **Cart state** — the cart is not persisted across browser contexts. Each test that needs a
  populated cart must add items within the same browser session.

---

## Assumptions

- No test environment is provided; all tests run against the live public site.
- No `.env` file is required — there are no secrets or config overrides needed.
- The API does not enforce rate limits in a way that would block a normal test run.

---

## What Would Come Next (With More Time)

- Checkout flow E2E test (address entry → order confirmation page, using the demo payment form)
- Visual regression snapshot tests for the homepage and product cards
- Cross-browser runs (Firefox, WebKit) via additional Playwright projects
- Test tagging (`@smoke`, `@regression`, `@api`) for selective CI execution
- A `fixtures/index.ts` extending Playwright's test to inject `ApiClient` and page objects
  automatically, reducing boilerplate in test files
- Allure or Playwright's built-in trace viewer integrated into the CI report pipeline
